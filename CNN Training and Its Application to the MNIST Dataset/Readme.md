# Image Recognition with CNN and Application of CNN to the MNIST Dataset

## Description:

LeNet-5 is one of the first neural network architecture proposed by Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yosuha Bengio and Patrick Haffner for handwritten and machine-printed charter recognition. This assignment focuses on applying LeNet-5 to classify handwritten digits. We try to analyze some limitations of this network by applying it to negative images.

## Description:

Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yosuha Bengio and Patrick Haffner proposed a neural network architecture for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition which they called LeNet-5. This assignment uses this LeNet-5 architecture to classify handwritten digits. We also try to understand the limitations of this architecture using negatives of same digits.

## Usage:

Run both notebooks in Google Colab on mnist data. Use GPU for faster outputs.
