## Image Recognition with CNN and Application of CNN to the MNIST Dataset

### Description:

Yann LeCun, Leon Bottou, Yosuha Bengio and Patrick Haffner proposed a neural network architecture for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition which they called LeNet-5. This assignment uses this LeNet-5 architecture to classify handwritten digits. We also try to understand the limitations of this architecture using negatives of same digits.

### Usage:

Run both notebooks in Google Colab on mnist data. Use GPU for faster outputs.
